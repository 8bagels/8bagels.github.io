I met with Kevin over at [Game Master Dice][gmdice] to purchase some dice that are making up my prototypes. I have some opaque, translucent, and even glitter dice. I want to keep costs low so I will probably end up ordering the opaque dice. Kevin has so many dice! It lots of fun looking through all of his options. He has been very helpful. Please check out his site to see a cool selection of awesome dice.
