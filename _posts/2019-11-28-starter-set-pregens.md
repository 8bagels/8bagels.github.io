Building on my recent [pre-gen draft post](/dice/2019/11/15/building-pregens-video.html) I finished converting the 5e Starter Set characters into a format to support the [Explorers Pack](/explorerspack). Below are links to all the pregens in a single file to print.

Filling out multiple full characters was a good experience to highlight a few things in the character sheet that I think can be improved in the next design touch up.
