The [Etsy Listing][etsy] is now live. The packs are listed at $5. I am mostly using Etsy as a system that will deal with sales tax and shipping and manage inventory levels and take payments. I don't plan on getting discovered through Etsy much but we will see. Etsy let me easily create a "variation" so I could sell a 5-pack for only $20. Go check it out, make a purchase if you feel inclined, and leave a review.
