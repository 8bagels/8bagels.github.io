I started a small local class tonight. Class members are all interested in starting their own business venture and we help each other along. It lasts 12 weeks and attempts to teach us the basics of starting and growing a small business. So what business venture am I going to pursue? I want to make a dice set to help new players of [D&D 5e][DnD5e] more easily and quickly jump into the game. Im excited to go through the process of designing a product and seeking feedback and refining it. This will be fun.
