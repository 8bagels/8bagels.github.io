As I promised I am trying to find time to develop some more resources to complement and support the [Explorers Pack](/explorerspack). So I transcribed the Starter Set characters into the Micro Character Sheet format. I will work on a more polished version, this is just the draft.

I also recorded a first cut of a video I would like to do to demonstrate their use. The final video will be more polished but I just wanted to show the progress I was making and the direction I am going.
